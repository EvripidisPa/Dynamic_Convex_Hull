This is an implementation of the dynamic convex hull algorithm by Overmars and van Leeuwen as described in [1].

This implementation is used in our paper on distribution-based query scheduling [2].

For the implementation, a special data structure named concatenable queue [3] is needed. We implemented the concatenable queue by using a 2-3 tree [3], and we implemented the 2-3 tree by extending the recently proposed leftleaning-red-black-tree (LLRB) [4]. Our extensions to LLRB include (1) storing data only at leaf nodes and (2) adding pointers to each leaf node, to point to the left and right neighbors of the node.
